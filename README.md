# proj2-flask
A starter project for using the Flask framework

Remember to remove these instructions and replace them with the 
material described at 
   https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/Classes/16W/cis399se/turnin.php

## Basic task

* Fork on github (or bitbucket)
* Clone in your workspace and on ix
* Enhance the class schedule display
  * The starting date of each week should display
  * The current week (just the column with the week number, or the
    whole row if you prefer) should be highlighted in some way. 

## In your workspace

Copy CONFIG.base.py to CONFIG.py, and edit it. You can probably use
the standard port 5000 if you are the only user of the computer. 
On ix, you should generate a random port number; numbers between 
4000 and 8000 are good.  (Numbers below 1000 are not permitted; 
those are 'privileged' 

type `make install`

You might have to edit the Makefile to find the right version of
pyvenv.  The Makefile has a hacky workaround for a bug in the ubuntu
version on ix.cs.uoregon.edu; I think this will still work in most
environments, although it will be slower.  Try it and let me know. 

If you can run flask applications in your development environment, the
application would might be run by
`   python3 syllabus.py`
and then reached with url
`   http://localhost:5000`

Note that we do not use app.cgi when we can run flask applications
directly. 

This should work on MacOS, or on your own Linux box if you have one. I
don't know about Windows.  It won't work this way on ix: 
There is only one port 5000 on ix, and we can't
all share it.

## On ix.cs.uoregon.edu

You should already have a top-level 'public_html' directory.  If you 
don't, then create one: 

`  mkdir public_html`

within the public_html directory, it's probably a good idea to create a cis399
or cis322 subdirectory.  I've optimistically called mine cis322: 

`   cd public_html;  mkdir cis322`

Public_html is for serving web pages from your personal account.  We're going to be using the department's Apache web server to run our application as a 'cgi-bin' subprocess.  To do that, we'll need to keep our application in a subdirectory called 'htbin'.  

`   cd cis322;  mkdir htbin`

This is where we'll clone the project from Github.  

`   cd htbin;  git clone https://theURLofYourForkedProject`

Then `cd` into that directory.  From here it's going to be similar but 
not quite identical to working in your own workspace. 

Copy CONFIG.base.py to CONFIG.py, and edit it. You can't use the default
port 5000 there ... in fact we probably won't be able to use the default 
Flask server at all, but just in case set it to use a randomly chosen port.

type `make install`

 The Makefile has a hacky workaround for a bug in the ubuntu
version on ix, so this should work.   (You'll learn much more about writing and 
using Makefiles in CIS 330.) 

What's really different is that we won't be running syllabus.py directly from the command line.  Instead, it is loaded as a Python module by a tiny Python program called app.cgi.  The 'cgi' suffix tells our web server to run the script, so we can reach it through the url `http://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~michal/cis322/htbin/proj2-flask/app.cgi/`.  

The URLs are long and ugly, but it will do for testing.
